# Dimensional Exponential Evolution (DEE) — v0.9 notes (preprint draft)

**Thesis**: The universe can be modeled as a **Dimensional Self-Growth System**. Effective dimension D(t) increases over time; information density Φ(t) grows approximately exponentially in D.

Key equations (informal):
- Φ(t) = exp(λ · D(t)), λ > 0
- dD/dt = α·E(t) − β·Ξ(t)
- dC/dt = k·exp(γ·D) − δ·C
